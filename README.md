# image_bytes

This project is for having low-level control of reading and writing raw and yuv images. It contains
a collection of methods that are useful for interacting with the raw bytes from images. If you don't
care to deal at the technical level you may be better served by trying `rawpixels.net` first. 
`opencv` now also supports converting a wide variety of bayer and yuv images.
